Run \`wait-for-task\` directly (not with \`&\`, \`nohup\`, or other backgrounding) - backgrounded processes cannot receive tasks

⏱️  HOW WAIT-FOR-TASK WORKS:
• While wait-for-task runs, you remain "frozen" - the tool continues executing while you wait
• The command may timeout before a task arrives. This is normal and expected behavior
• The shell host enforces timeouts to ensure agents remain responsive and can pick up new jobs
• When wait-for-task terminates (timeout or after task completion), restart it immediately
• Restarting quickly ensures users and other agents don't have to wait for your availability`;
